# 🐮 牛 Calculator (Just for Fun!)

I made this small offline web app to quickly calculate 牛 points during the game.

Instead of getting confused about rules or counting wrongly,
just tap the cards and let the system decide 😄

## Features

- Tap-to-select 5 cards (duplicates allowed)
- Automatic 牛 detection
- Automatic 点数 calculation
- 3 / 6 interchangeable logic
- Special hands:
  - 牛 1 – 牛 9
  - 牛牛 (10)
  - Pair X
  - 牛冬菇
  - 五张鬼

## Why This Exists

Sometimes counting gets messy.
Sometimes 3 and 6 give headache.
Sometimes we are just too lazy to do the math.

This calculator handles the combinations automatically and applies priority rules correctly.

## Disclaimer

These rules follow the version that my friends and I play.

Different groups may have different variations of 牛.  
You might disagree, or feel that some rules are incomplete — that’s okay!

This calculator is based purely on our table rules.

## Usage

1. Open the GitHub Pages link.
2. Add to Home Screen (Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen).
3. Works offline after first load.

Made for learning GitHub + just for fun.
